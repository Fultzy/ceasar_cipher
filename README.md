# ceasar_cipher
The Odin Project


bloated first attempet at a ceasar cipher.
1. intakes a string and an integer, 
2. the string will be taken apart, 
3. indexed and shifted by the integer.
4. then turned back to letters and displayed.

problems
1. symbols return as 'A' in the output message.
2. for some reason q-z dont work properly. 
3. large offsets/shifts cut off letters. 
4. needs more memes.
